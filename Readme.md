# Memex Features

A browser extension to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents.
Its name and functionalities are heavily inspired by [Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex](http://memex.link/S1zVMgKzX/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

## All Data stored locally

All personal data is stored and processed on your own computer and will **never** leave your computer without you either sharing, syncing or backing it up to an external cloud.
For more info please see our [privacy policy](https://worldbrain.io/privacy)

## Mobile apps for iOS & Android + Encrypted Sync

With [Memex Go](https://getmemex.com) you can save & organise content on the go.

## No VC money, no Exit: Your data & attention stays yours

Memex is funded without VC money or selling shares. Instead we are funded with a model called "Steward Ownership". This model ensures that the company can never be sold and our investors are rewarded with a capped profit share. This way we will never get the incentives to optimise our company for maximising growth & shareholder profits to the expense of your privacy, provider freedom or attention.
More about our choice you find [in this post](https://community.worldbrain.io/t/why-worldbrain-io-does-not-take-venture-capital/75).

‚õÖBackup and restore your data to any of your favorite cloud providers & Google Drive

üì≤Import bookmarks and history from other services

‚å® Keyboard Shortcuts for everything

üóÇTab manager: add all open tabs to a collection or tag
